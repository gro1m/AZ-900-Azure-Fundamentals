## Motivation for Cloud
renting ressources.
ressources are:
* compute power
* storage 
* secure network connections
* analytics

cloud providers:
* Microsoft
* Amazon
* Google

Main terms:
* availability
* fault tolerance
* scalability -> 1 VM to 100 VMs in some seconds
* elasticity -> amount of VMs by demand
* global reach -> services near to place of use
* predictive cost considerations
* disaster recovery
* security
* economies of scale -> smaller costs, as provider can scale better and stronger (data centers)

capital expenditure (capex):
* build infrastructure at beginning (lot of upfront cost), then reduce costs.

operational expenditure (opex):
* consumption-based model: only pay for effectively needed services; you need to pay immediately!
* example: Black Friday

public cloud:
* secure network-connection
* no capex
* pay-what-you-use
* fast

private cloud:
* own datacenter
* own ressource

hybrid cloud:
* public + private cloud
* highest flexibility

## Types of Cloud Services
* IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service
* PaaS: Platform as a Service
* SaaS: Software as a Service

### IaaS
need to manage updates of the following:
* Server
* VMs
* Storage
* Operating System
* networks

### PaaS
need to manage the following:
* application
Amount of CPUs etc. does not need to be managed

### SaaS
software ready to use hosted in the cloud.
Example: Office 365.
Need to manage:
* Data & Access
Example: Word Online , where to store data and who has access
